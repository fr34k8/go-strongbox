  Uh-oh.  It looks like someone forgot to write RELEASE NOTES

  Release Notes are an important part of the CI/CD pipeline
  and the shipping / release process.  They detail the set of
  changes that have been made since the last release, for people
  to review before opting to upgrade.

  Ideally, you would write these as changes are made and commits
  are merged.  Failing that, you really MUST write them before
  the shipit job is run.

  Release notes must be put in 'ci/release_notes.md'
